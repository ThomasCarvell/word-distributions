# A experiment into letter distributions in words

This data experiment is based of an article written by Stephen Wolfram on [what is chat GPT doing and how does it work](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/). In the first part of this article he writes about how words can be derived by working out the probablility of each letter following a specific combination of words. I used the entire harry potter series to measure these probabilities and compile them into numpy arrays. I then use the tables to generate random nonsensical but legible words.
